🌍 Project: Realmweaver

📜 Overview

Realmweaver is a procedural world generator that creates dynamic, evolving worlds filled with nations, cities, biomes, and historical events. Inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Civilization, the goal is to generate a self-sustaining simulated world that develops over time.

🎯 Goals

Generate a World Map (grid-based, randomized biomes)

Place Cities & Civilizations (kingdoms, alliances, settlements)

Simulate History (wars, trade, diplomacy, legendary events)

Expand & Evolve (optional mechanics like economy, quests, and heroes)

🏗 Project Roadmap

Phase 1: Procedural World Generation 🌍

✅ Generate a grid-based map (e.g., 50x50 or 100x100)
✅ Assign terrain types (land, water, mountains, deserts, forests, etc.)
✅ Use noise functions for realistic biome placement
✅ Visualize the world using matplotlib

Phase 2: Civilizations & Settlements 🏰

✅ Place cities based on terrain suitability (near water, in valleys, etc.)
✅ Generate faction names & characteristics (peaceful, warlike, traders, etc.)
✅ Assign rulers and population growth over time
✅ Establish initial diplomatic relations

Phase 3: Simulated History 📜

✅ Advance the timeline year by year
✅ Simulate wars, alliances, and expansion
✅ Track major historical events in a log
✅ Allow civilizations to collapse or grow into empires

Phase 4: Expanding the Simulation (Optional) 🔥

✅ Economy & Trade (cities produce and trade resources)
✅ Fantasy Elements (monsters, heroes, magic, lost ruins)
✅ Story Generation (randomly generated myths & legends)
✅ Save & Load Worlds (export to JSON for later analysis)

💾 Tech Stack

Python (Core logic & simulation)

Matplotlib (Map visualization)

Noise/Perlin noise libraries (Terrain generation)

JSON/SQLite (Data storage for world state & history)

🔥 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Labrosh/Realmweaver.git
cd realmweaver

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the world generator:

python realmweaver.py

🎭 Future Ideas

Interactive Mode (Allow players to influence world events)

AI-Controlled NPCs (Civilizations that adapt to external threats)

Expanding to a Playable Game (Turn-based or real-time strategy elements)

📌 Notes

This project will evolve over time, starting with a simple world map before moving on to advanced historical simulation.

The focus is on procedural generation & worldbuilding, not making a full game (but it could be expanded into one later!).

🚀 Contribute & Expand

Want to expand the simulation? Here are ways to contribute:

Improve world generation (better biomes, more terrain variety)

Enhance history simulation (more detailed wars, events, and diplomacy)

Optimize performance (handle large worlds efficiently)
