# Core logic for generating the world
# our first step will be making a basic 50x50 grid - this was suggested because it is nice and big, and simple like me! ðŸ˜Š

USE_EMOJI = True  # This will be our horrible variable to switch between emojis and letters - I want to make a proper settings or option menu later
# UPDATE - NO EMOJIS LOOKS HORRIBLE - Emojis are on true until I fix them 

# Lets see - this should 'make the world' - it looks like the code is just mashing together a bunch of random terrain types to make a grid.
# this looks gross, so try to revisit - maybe we can move some logic to put stuff that makes sense in correct places?
